Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SQL Code:
	select count (*)
	from table;
	
i. Attribute table 	= 10000
ii. Business table 	= 10000
iii. Category table 	= 10000 
iv. Checkin table 	= 10000
v. elite_years table 	= 10000
vi. friend table 	= 10000
vii. hours table 	= 10000
viii. photo table 	= 10000
ix. review table 	= 10000
x. tip table 		= 10000
xi. user table 		= 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
				
SQL CODE:
	select count (distinct id) from business;
	select count (distinct business_id) from hours;
	select count (distinct business_id) from category;
	select count (distinct business_id) from attribute;		
	select count (distinct business_id), count(distinct id), count(distinct user_id)
	from review;
	select count (distinct business_id) from checkin
	select count (distinct id) from photo
	select count (distinct user_id), count (distinct business_id) 
	from tip;
	select count (distinct id) from user;
	select count (distinct user_id) from friend;
	select count (distinct user_id) from elite_years;
	

				key			number of records

i. Business 	= 		id				10000 
ii. Hours 	=	business_id				1562
iii. Category 	=	business_id				2643
iv. Attribute 	=	business_id				1115 
v. Review 	=business_id, id, user_id		8090, 10000, 9581
vi. Checkin 	= 	business_id				493
vii. Photo	=	id					10000
viii. Tip	= user_id, business_id				537, 3979
ix. User 	= 	id					10000
x. Friend 	=  	user_id					11
xi. Elite_years =	user_id					2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:	3.7082
		select min (stars), max(stars), avg (stars) 
		from review;
	

	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:	3.6549 
		select min (stars), max(stars), avg (stars) 
		from business;	

	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Answer: Yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         Answer: Yes

         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	Based on the table below, there seems correlation between working hours and their rating. On the weekend, most people want to hangout and spend time with friends or family. So they choose restaurant or maybe go to groceries to buy something on the weekend

	SQL code used for analysis:
	select business.name,
		business.city,
		category.category,
		business.stars,
		hours.hours, 
		business.review_count,
		business.address,
		business.postal_code
	from (business INNER JOIN category on business.id=category.business_id)
		INNER JOIN hours on hours.business_id=category.business_id
	where business.city = 'Edinburgh'
	group by business.stars;
	+------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+---------------------------+-------------+	
	| name                   | city      | category    | stars | hours                | review_count | address                   | postal_code |
	| Mood                   | Edinburgh | Nightlife   |   2.0 | Thursday|22:30-3:00  |           11 | 1 Greenside Place         | EH1 3AA     |

	| Miros Cantina Mexicana | Edinburgh | Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|12:00-22:30 |           37 | 184 Rose Street, West End | EH2 4BA     |
	+------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+---------------------------+-------------+
	
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
	i. Difference 1:
		The business that is still open have higher star
         
	ii. Difference 2:
		The business that is still open have more review   
         
         
	SQL code used for analysis:
	Select business.name,
		business.is_open,
		category.category,
		business.stars,
		hours.hours,
		business.review_count,
		business.postal_code
	from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) 
		inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
	where business.city = 'Edinburgh' 
	group by business.is_open;

	+------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
	| name                   | is_open | category    | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code |
	+------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
	| Mood                   |       0 | Nightlife   |   2.0 | Thursday|22:30-3:00  |           11 | EH1 3AA     |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
	i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
		I choose to finding correlation between the number of reviews and star
         
	ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
		First, I need two tables (Business and user table). I'll join these two tables and sort them based on star to see if there is a correlation between the number of stars and review. The reason I do this analysis is to find out whether there is a relationship between the reviews given by other customers to the number of product sales. Often customers see the reviews given before buying the product. then purchasing products based on reviews will affect the rating and review of the store 
                  
	iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         	+-----------------------------------+------------------------+-------+--------------+------------------------+
